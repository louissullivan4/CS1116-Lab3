The program implements a self-processing page:
  The program initially displays a form, which has a textfield, which allow the user to enter a country.
  On submit, the program takes the country that the user entered and searches the database for all eurovision winners 
  from that country. It displays the form again and, just below the form, it displays an HTML table that displays the data 
  you retrieved from the database.
